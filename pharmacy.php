<font style="position:absolute;left:0.5%;top:60%;font-size:21px"><b>Why Choose the University Health Center Pharmacy?</b></font>
<font style="position:absolute;left:0.5%;top:65%;font-size:19.5px">
Here are a few reasons we think the University Health Center Pharmacy is a great option for students:
<br><br>
<u>Convenience:</u> &nbsp
We are located right here on campus, an easy walk from the residence halls, and in the same building as all of the Health Center clinicians.  If you are seeing a doctor at the Health centre, you are just steps away from the pharmacy.<br> <br>

<u>Focus on Students:</u> &nbsp
The pharmacy is here for you!  Our staff has over 50 years of combined experience in College Health Pharmacy practice and has a firm grasp of the unique health care issues that face students today.  We work very closely with the Health Center medical staff to make sure that prescriptions filled here are optimized for efficacy, appropriateness and affordability.<br> <br>

<u>Price:</u> &nbsp
The pharmacy does its best to keep prices affordable.  Many prescription and nonprescription items are significantly cheaper than at a traditional retailer even maximum medicines are free of cost for students.
