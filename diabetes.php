The Health Center offers a wide range of diabetes management services for all types of diabetes as well as pre-diabetes.  These include office visits with a clinician, a certified diabetes educator, or a dietician.  We can provide additional care and supplement the care patients are receiving with your primary care physician. We also offer A1C testing and meter & pump downloads and reviews.

A 3-credit course is available to students who would like help managing their Type 1 Diabetes.  This class meets Mon/Wed/Fri  from 11 to 11:50 in the Health Center.

We're here to answer all of your diabetes management questions.

<LI>Choose tasty, low-carb veggies, like mushrooms, onions, eggplant, tomatoes, Brussels sprouts, and low-carb squashes, like zucchini.
<LI>Go beyond your regular salad and try kale, spinach, and chard.
<LI>Plain water is always good, but water infused with fruits and vegetables is more interesting. Cut up a lemon or cucumber and put it in your water, or make ice cubes with some flavoring in them.
<LI>For a different twist, mix the melon or berries with plain yogurt, or put them in ice cubes to drink.
<LI>Try legumes like dried beans, peas, and lentils. You can even enjoy a black bean and corn salsa with your raw vegetables.
<LI>Good fat choices include olive oil, avocado, and fatty fishes.
<LI>Peanut butter on a celery stick is a good fat and protein mix for a healthy, satisfying snack.
