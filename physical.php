Physical therapy or physiotherapy is a physical medicine and rehabilitation specialty that, by using mechanical
 force and movements, remediates impairments and promotes mobility, function, and quality of life through examination, diagnosis, prognosis,
 and physical intervention.<br>
Our skilled staff has over 50 years of combined experience treating overuse syndromes, postural imbalances, trauma, athletic injuries,
 acute or chronic pain. We strive to provide the highest quality, comprehensive rehabilitation
 to enable students to overcome pain, dysfunction and disability. Our physical therapists, athletic trainers
 work with students on a one-on-one basis to determine all of the factors involved in an injury/disability and develop an individualized
 treatment plan to meet each patient's treatment goals. We work collaboratively with all members of a patient's healthcare team to ensure excellent
 communication and follow through.
