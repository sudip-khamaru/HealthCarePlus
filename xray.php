The X-Ray area is located on the first floor of the Health Center building near the Laboratory. Registered radiological technologists take all general diagnostic X-Rays, including orthopedic X-Rays, by order of any physician or nurse practitioner. The cost of the X-Rays is often substantially lower than in other radiology clinics. Consulting radiologists interpret the X-Rays.
