Clinical pathology covers a wide range of laboratory functions and is concerned with the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. Clinical pathologists are healthcare providers with special training who often direct all of the special divisions of the lab. This may include the blood bank, clinical chemistry and biology, toxicology, hematology, immunology and serology, and microbiology. Clinical pathology also involves maintenance of information systems, research, and quality control.</br></br>
A clinical pathologist looks at blood, urine, and other body fluid specimens under a microscope, or with other diagnostic tools, to observe levels of certain chemicals and/or other substances in the body. A diagnosis or determination to conduct further study is then made based on the test results.
